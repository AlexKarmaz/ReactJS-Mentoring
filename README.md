# ReactJS-Mentoring

<h2>Task 2: Webpack</h2>
<p>Create package.json file and install React, Redux, React-Redux, React-Router, Jest. Install and configure Webpack & 
Babel to get build artifact by running npm command.</p> 
<p>Set DEV and PROD build configuration. Use env variables, dev server, optimizations for PROD build. Set up testing. 
You should have test command in your package.json file, which will run your future tests. Don’t use any React 
boilerplate (like create-react-app) for this task.</p>

<h2>Task 3: Components part 1</h2>
<p>Write components implementing HTML markup for required design for home page of
InVision prototype (Only UI part). For this part, no need to implement API calls and
routing, the task can be done with mocked data.</p>
<p>Use <ErrorBoundary> component for catching and displaying errors
<a>https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html</a>. You could create one component and wrap
all your application or use several components.</p>
